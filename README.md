# World-Data-League-2022-PR
Contributions of the Prometheus Razor team to World Data League 2022

Prometheus Razor, composed by Luís Ventura, (Pedro Leal)[https://github.com/pedro-m-leal], Aníbal Silva, José Sá and Artur Amorim, solved two challenges for World Data League 2022, finishing 14th out of 50.
The relevant files are the Jupyter notebooks (one for each stage) and their HTML versions, the Markdown executive summaries and the video pitches.

Stage 1 - Predict Waste Production for its Reduction - Here, we have analyzed waste production patterns for the city of Austin, Texas and provided a tool for policy makers to forecast
the amount of waste generated. We have also studied the shift in consumer patterns from services to goods during COVID-19 due to mandatory lockdowns using Google Mobility data.
Finally, we briefly investigated Austin's demographics and its relation to waste production.

Stage 2 - Optimization of Soft-Mobility Drop-off Points - Here, we have analyzed public transport mobility data for the city of Porto and designed an attribution model for e-scooter
parks based on Porto amenity data, focussing on the target demographic of 16-35 years of age.

More details can be found in the individual Markdown files "Stage_x_Submission_ExecSum.md".
